# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm JoÃ£o Lucas Viegas

### Aspiring to be a Software Architect that builds reliable and well-designed systems.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on **Creating a few (plenty) "prototype-wares" in Rust while I try to figure how software architecture works. Meantime I'll be reading books about how NOT to make "crapware" in general.**

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning **Rust (Easy, reliable and fun). Side projects being done on any given tech I feel like so that can be: Java/Kotlin; C#; Python; C++; PHP; Node.js; Flutter.**

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on **Any given project that brings me joy, fun and plenty of headaches...**

- ðŸ“« How to reach me **santosviegasj@gmail.com**
