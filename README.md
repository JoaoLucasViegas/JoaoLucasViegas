# Hi 👋, I'm João Lucas Viegas

### Aspiring to become a Software Architect

- 🔭 I'm currently working on **creating a few implementations in Rust, Python and C++ while I try to figure out designs of software architecture. In the meantime I'll be reading books about how NOT to make "crapware".**

- 🌱 I'm currently studying **Rust (easy, reliable and fun), Software Designs and DevOps**

- 🛠️ I develop softwares with **Rust; Java/Kotlin; C/C++/C#; Python; PHP; Node.js; Flutter.**

- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on **Any given project that brings me joy, fun and plenty of headaches...**

- 📫 How to reach me **santosviegasj@gmail.com**
